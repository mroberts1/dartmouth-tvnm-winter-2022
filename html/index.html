    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>In the age of social networks and participatory culture, television is widely regarded as an obsolete, 20th-century medium, the box in the corner of the living room that nobody watches anymore. Yet television continues to be watched by millions of people around the globe today, while over the past decade it has been undergoing a makeover of its own for today’s networked, multi-platform media environments.</p>
    <p>This course examines the transformation of television in both its commercial and public-service forms by the rise of the internet as a mass medium, YouTube and participatory culture, and most recently, social networks and mobile communication. On the one hand, it will show, digital technologies and computer networks have disrupted the historical power relations between television networks and their audiences, enabling viewers to watch programming whenever and wherever they like, to avoid commercials, and to become producers themselves; yet at the same time, networks and advertisers are quickly finding new ways to adapt older business models and forms of storytelling to today’s multi-platform media environment.</p>
    <h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Students will acquire the following range of abilities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Understanding of historical models of television and major phases of television history; the structural relationship between television networks, advertisers and audiences; and the transformation of this relationship associated with digital media technologies and computer networks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Conceptual and analytical understanding of television’s place within contemporary digital media environments through engagement with critical and theoretical scholarship on the subject.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Familiarity with new and emerging programming formats designed for multi-platform delivery.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

You might also list this resource on <a href="http://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu/learning/materials/sources-and-citations-dartmouth">proper citation of sources</a>. It can be even more powerful for students if you include on your syllabus a personal statement about the Academic Honor Principle.
