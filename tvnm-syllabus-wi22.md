### Description
In the age of social networks and participatory culture, television is widely regarded as an  obsolete, 20th-century medium, the box in the corner of the living room that nobody watches  anymore.  Yet  television  continues  to  be  watched  by  millions  of  people  around  the  globe  today,  while over the past decade it has been undergoing a makeover of its own for today’s  networked,  multi-platform media environments.

This  course  examines  the  transformation  of  television  in  both  its  commercial  and  public-service  forms by the rise of the internet as a mass medium, YouTube and participatory culture, and  most recently, social  networks and  mobile communication.  On the  one hand,  it will  show,  digital technologies and computer networks have disrupted the historical power relations  between television networks and their audiences, enabling viewers to watch programming  whenever  and  wherever  they  like,  to  avoid  commercials,  and  to  become  producers  themselves;  yet at the same time, networks and advertisers are quickly finding new ways to adapt older  business  models and forms of storytelling  to today's multi-platform media environment.

### Outcomes
Students will  acquire the following  range of abilities:

1. Understanding of historical models of television and major phases of television history;  the  structural  relationship  between  television  networks,  advertisers  and  audiences;  and  the transformation of this relationship associated with digital media technologies and  computer networks.

2. Conceptual and analytical understanding of television’s place within contemporary  digital  media  environments  through  engagement  with  critical  and  theoretical  scholarship  on the subject.

3.  Familiarity  with  new  and  emerging  programming  formats  designed  for  multi-platform  delivery.

### Expectations & Norms  
**Dartmouth’s Academic Honor Principle**
In addition to including on your syllabus the link to Judicial Affairs that explains the [Academic Honor Principle](http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/index.html) , it is important that you discuss with your students the Honor Principle and its specific relationship to your courses. You might also list this resource on [proper citation of sources](http://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu/learning/materials/sources-and-citations-dartmouth). It can be even more powerful for students if you include on your syllabus a personal statement about the Academic Honor Principle. Please consider clarifying under what circumstances it is acceptable to you for students to work together on assignments. If you have questions about the Honor Principle, please contact your department/program Chair or your Associate Dean.

### Class Climate & Inclusivity
At Dartmouth, we value integrity, responsibility, and respect for the rights and interests of others, all central to our Principles of Community. We are dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive campus where all have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities Dartmouth offers. We strive to promote an environment of sexual respect, safety, and well-being. In its policies and standards, Dartmouth demonstrates unequivocally that sexual assault, gender-based harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking are not tolerated in our community.

The Sexual Respect Website (sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu) provides a wealth of information on your rights and obligations with regard to sexual respect and resources that are available to all in our community. As a faculty member, I am obligated to share disclosures regarding conduct under Title IX with Dartmouth's Title IX Coordinator.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact Dartmouth's Title IX Coordinator [Kristi.Clemens@Dartmouth.edu](mailto:Kristi.Clemens@Dartmouth.edu) and deputies if appropriate.

### Dartmouth Policies

### Student Accessibility and Accommodations
Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are encouraged to schedule a phone/Zoom meeting with me as early in the term as possible. This conversation will help to establish what supports are built into my course. In order for accommodations to be authorized, students are required to consult with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; [Getting Started with SAS webpage;](https://students.dartmouth.edu/student-accessibility/students/working-sas/getting-started) [student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu](mailto:student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu); 603-646-9900) and to request an accommodation email be sent to me. We will then work together with SAS if accommodations need to be modified based on the learning environment. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

### Mental Health
_COSL, with the approval and consideration of the COI, recommends adding a “Statement on Mental Health” below to your syllabi_:

The academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including your [undergraduate dean](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~upperde/) , [Counseling and Human Development](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chd/) , and the [Student Wellness Center](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~healthed/) .

### Religious Observances
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

To assist with calendar planning and awareness of our diverse religious and spiritual community, please see  the  [Holy Day Calendar](https://students.dartmouth.edu/tucker/spiritual-life/about-spiritual-life/holy-day-calendar). The list represents major holy days which may impact accommodation of campus events in general, as well as student course attendance, exams, Commencement and participation in activities during the Academic Year. There is also a list of  [additional extensive holy day listings and descriptions](http://www.interfaith-calendar.org/2019.htm)  for the 2020 Academic Year. For any questions about these dates or other concerns, please contact [Rabbi Daveen Litwin](mailto:Daveen.H.Litwin@Dartmouth.edu), Dean and Chaplain of the Tucker Center for Spiritual and Ethical Life.
